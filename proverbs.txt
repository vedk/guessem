All that glitters is not gold
Every dog has his day
Never do tomorrow what you can do today
Two wrongs do not make a right
The pen is mightier than the sword
When in Rome do as the Romans
Fortune favors the bold
Better late than never
Birds of a feather flock together
The early bird catches the worm
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Actions speak louder than words
Practice makes perfect
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Necessity is the mother of invention
Good things come to those who wait
Honesty is the best policy
A friend in need is a friend indeed
Better safe than sorry
Every cloud has a silver lining
Haste makes waste
Jack of all trades master of none
Knowledge is power
Look before you leap
Rome wasnt built in a day
Slow and steady wins the race
Still waters run deep
Time is money
What goes up must come down
You reap what you sow
